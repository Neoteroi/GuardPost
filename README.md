# Authentication and authorization framework for Python apps
Basic framework to handle authentication and authorization in asynchronous
Python applications.

**Features:**

- strategy to implement authentication (who or what is using a service?)
- strategy to implement authorization (is the acting identity authorized to do a certain action?)
- support for dependency injection for classes handling authentication and
  authorization requirements
- built-in support for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) authentication

This library is freely inspired by [authorization in ASP.NET
Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/policies?view=aspnetcore-2.2);
although its implementation is extremely different.

## Installation

```bash
pip install neoteroi-auth
```

To install with support for `JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)` validation:

```
pip install neoteroi-auth[jwt]
```

### Examples

For examples, refer to the [examples folder](./examples).

## If you have doubts about authentication vs authorization...
`Authentication` answers the question: _Who is the user who is initiating the
action?_, or more in general: _Who is the user, or what is the service, that is
initiating the action?_.

`Authorization` answers the question: _Is the user, or service, authorized to
do something?_.

Usually, to implement authorization, is necessary to have the context of the
entity that is executing the action.

## Usage in BlackSheep
`neoteroi-auth` is used in the second version of the
[BlackSheep](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/) web framework, to implement
[authentication and authorization
strategies](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/authentication/) for request
handlers.
